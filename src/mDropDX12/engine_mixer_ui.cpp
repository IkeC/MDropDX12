  // instruction on screen and it was the one thing that could not work

  // RebuildFonts destroys and re-creates every control in the window. Doing
  // that from inside WM_SIZE runs it in the middle of the sizing loop, and the
  // drag fights it: Shane could not resize the window vertically at all while
  // the row count was crossing boundaries under the mouse.

  // Any size change, not just one that moves a fader-row boundary.

  // few anchored -- so resizing while Options was in front changed nothing
