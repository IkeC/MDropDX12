  render_context.h — per-simulation state for independent mirror rendering.

  INTERNAL FRAGMENT: included by engine.h ONLY, inside `namespace mdrop`,
  after td_mysounddata / td_vertinfo / MYVERTEX are visible. Do not include
  from anywhere else.

  Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-independent-mirror-sims-design.md
  Each independent mirror size/orientation group gets one MirrorSimContext:
  its own preset states (own EEL VMs with per-context reg00-99 + gmegabuf
  blocks), own warp mesh, own time base and audio snapshot — sharing only
  read-only resources (PSOs, textures, device) with the primary.

// fragment (global namespace — do NOT forward-declare it here inside mdrop).

// Immutable copy of the primary's audio analysis, published once per primary
// frame (render thread) and copied by each sim thread at its frame start.
// Contains td_mysounddata wholesale — the exact struct every per-frame /
// shape / wave EEL feed reads — so sims consume identical audio.

// What the render sequence needs to know about the surface it is drawing.
//
// The primary path (DX12_RenderWarpAndComposite) and the mirror worker's path
// (RenderClassicOrientPipeline) are two hand-copied bodies, and #15 exists
// because a mitigation written into one does not reach the other. That has
// shipped twice: canvasMax on 2026-08-23, and the feedback damp on 2026-08-27
// (`09dadf8`, "the feedback damp never reached mirrored displays").
//
// The two bodies are NOT two halves of one function. The primary runs 17
// stages; the mirror runs 4 of them -- warp, blur, inject, comp -- and skips
// the first-frame clear, supertexts, Shadertoy, video in/out, motion vectors,
// the Buffer A pass and the feedback blit entirely. So they are unified stage
// by stage rather than merged wholesale, and this is the carrier: the few
// things a stage needs that genuinely differ between the two.
//
// The canvas size is the interesting one. Both paths apply the same
// mitigations, but each at ITS OWN canvas -- the primary at m_nTexSizeX/Y and
// the mirror at its sim size -- which is exactly why the damp could not simply
// be hoisted into a shared function without one: `EffectiveFeedbackDamp()`
// reads the primary's size off the engine, so a mirror calling it would be
// damped for a canvas it is not rendering.
// The compiled pipeline objects for ONE preset. Raw pointers: the context
// borrows these for the duration of a record and never owns them, so nothing
// here AddRefs. Ownership stays with whatever holds the ComPtr -- today the
// Engine, and under #184 the context's own PShaderSet.

  // mysound off the engine animates it at the PRIMARY's tempo. That is exactly

  // `fps`, `progress` and `bass`/`mid`/`treb` were the primary's, while the
  // same preset's per-frame EEL had already been handed the context's values
  // by LoadPerFrameEvallibVarsCtx.

  // them to MATCH LoadPerFrameEvallibVarsCtx rather than merely to be
  // per-context -- the shader uniform and the preset's own code have to agree
  // about what time it is. Engine::FillAnimInputs is the single place that

  // (#186 phase 2); nothing a record touches mutates the engine any more.
