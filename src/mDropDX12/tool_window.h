  //                             STRETCHES.
  //
  // A control that is never anchored simply stays where it was built, which is
  // what every control did before this existed -- so a window adopts anchoring
  // one control at a time, and a window that adopts none behaves exactly as it
  // always has.
  //
  // Once a window anchors anything, OnResize lays it out instead of destroying
  // and rebuilding it: no flicker, no lost text, no re-reading files, and one
  // DeferWindowPos batch instead of a teardown per mouse-move.
