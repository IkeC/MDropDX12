// pipe_server.h — Named Pipe IPC server for Milkwave visualizers
// Replaces the hidden WM_COPYDATA IPC window with a named pipe.
// Pipe name: \\.\pipe\Milkwave_<PID>
//
// Milkwave_ is SHARED: Milkwave Visualizer publishes it too, and every
// discovery tool -- Milkwave Remote, the MCP server, vis.py, the probe
// harness -- enumerates it to find something to drive.
//
// A second namespace, mDxChild_<PID>, existed for -child instances so they
// stayed out of that set: a child owned no external interface, and its pipe
// was one. #186 phase 6 deleted -child, and the namespace with it.
// Supports multiple concurrent clients (e.g., MilkwaveRemote + MCP).

// caller was already sending. DispatchSignal can only send a wParam a table
// entry carries, so SIGNAL|FULLSCREEN meant "ensure exit" and could never
// enter fullscreen. The toggle needs a value of its own, and every sender has
// to name the same one, hence these live here rather than at each call site.

// A base is [A-Za-z0-9_], 1 to 39 characters.
//
// It arrives over IPC from anyone who can reach the pipe, and it becomes a path
// component under \.\pipe\ -- a backslash in it would quietly create a name
// somewhere else. Rejected rather than sanitised: a caller who sent something
// odd should hear about it.

// The base a CHILD of an instance serving `parentBase` should use.
//
// `parentBase` is what PipeServer::GetNameBase() returns -- "mdx12test_", with
// the separator Start concatenates, or "" for the default. The child's base is
// the parent's word with "Child" on the end, so an instance and its children
// sit in one namespace: rename a parent and its whole tree moves with it, and
// the user's children keep mDxChild_ to themselves.

// Per-client connection context — one per connected client, owned by PipeServer.

    // STRICT dispatch, for THIS connection only (issue 102).
    //
    // An unrecognised keyword normally falls through to the script engine, and
    // that is load-bearing -- Milkwave Remote depends on it, and NEXT, PREV,
    // LOCK and everything else the button board speaks arrive that way. But it
    // also means a caller's typo is neither rejected nor ignored: it becomes a
    // script line, and an unrecognised script line is DRAWN ON THE VISUALIZER.
    // A probe that sent LOGLEVEL=4 (the real keyword is SET_LOGLEVEL=) painted
    // itself across the render window mid-run.
    //
    // So strictness lives here rather than in a setting: it belongs to one
    // client for the life of its connection, it cannot be persisted, and it
    // cannot outlive the caller that asked for it. A client that never mentions
    // STRICT is never affected, which is what lets the default rule and this
