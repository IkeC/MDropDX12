// forgejo#21. Every external consumer — Milkwave Remote, the MCP server, the
// milk2-probe harness, third-party scripts — used to learn the command set from
// docs/Scripts.md and then hope the binary it was talking to was the one those
// docs described. Two thirds of the dispatched keywords were undocumented when
// this was written, and nothing reported the app's own version over the pipe.
//
// The table below is the answer to both. It is hand-maintained, and
// tools/milk2-probe/test_ipc_help.py fails the moment the dispatcher and the
// table disagree, so it cannot quietly rot the way the document did.
//
// NOTE ON UNKNOWN COMMANDS: LaunchMessage deliberately passes anything it does
// not match to ExecuteScriptLine, because Milkwave Remote depends on it. So
// "absent from this table" NEVER means "invalid" — the script vocabulary
// reachable through that fallback is listed here too, in kScriptCommands.

// BUMP THIS FOR ANY CHANGE A CLIENT CAN DEPEND ON, INCLUDING AN ADDITIVE ONE.

// It used to read "bumped when an existing command's contract changes", and by
// that rule it was correctly 1 for the whole of the v3 work -- new commands
// change no existing contract, an added field breaks no tolerant parser, and an
// optional trailing argument is backwards compatible by construction. So the
// number stood still while the surface grew, and nobody forgot: the rule said
// not to move it (forgejo#74).
//
// That is backwards. A client does not need to detect BREAKAGE -- a breaking
// change is the case where the old client is already broken and no number saves
// it. What a client needs to detect is ADDITION: has this build got the thing I
// want to use? So the number moves whenever the answer to that question
// changes.
//
//   1  the original surface, through the v2.11.0 release
//   2  the mixer view, the arrangement token, and both fader fields
//   3  the hotkey diagnostics: what is bound globally, and what is HELD
//   4  groups= on MIXER_FADER (forgejo#77)
//   5  named display-profile IPC, and DISPLAY_PROFILE_STARTUP (forgejo#95)
//   6  SET_ALL_FULLSCREEN=/GET_ALL_FULLSCREEN, fs= on GET_CHILDREN (forgejo#96)
//   7  SET_IDLE_ACTIVE=/GET_IDLE_ACTIVE -- trigger the idle action on demand
//   8  SET_VSYNC=/GET_VSYNC -- the one render setting with no IPC form, which
//      made every automated frame-rate measurement read the monitor rather
//      than the engine, because it defaults on (#121)

// ── Named capabilities, for a client that degrades per FEATURE ───────────
//
// A single number forces a client to treat a build as all-or-nothing, which is
// not how they behave: MilkDrop Remote has an independent fallback for the
// drawn order, the token, the battery field and the push, and will happily use
// three of the four. A list also says what it means, where `protocol=7` does
// not.
//
// Rules for this list, because a list that cannot be trusted is worse than no
// list at all:
//
//   * It is APPEND-ONLY. A name, once shipped, keeps its meaning forever --
//     clients in the wild are testing for that exact string. Retiring a
//     capability means shipping a new name, never redefining an old one.
//   * A name means "this build answers these verbs and fields". It says
//     nothing about whether the subsystem is enabled or whether hardware is
//     present, which are runtime questions with runtime answers.
//   * ABSENCE means not declared, which is not the same as not present. Only
//     capabilities a client is expected to gate on are listed; the rest of the
//     surface is discovered from HELP as it always was.
//
// Add a name in the same commit that adds the thing it names, and bump
// MDROP_IPC_PROTOCOL alongside it.
